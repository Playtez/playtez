# Working with yaml using Netlify-CMS & Gatsby

How to configure an image posted on the body widget, in the content manager.

Assuming this is your starting point...

```
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: master

media_folder: static/img   // media_folder at the file level
public_folder: /img      // public_folder at the file level

collections:
  - name: 'blog'
    label: 'Blog'
    folder: 'content'
    create: true
    slug: 'index'
    media_folder: ''      // media_folder at the file level
    public_folder: ''     // public_folder at the collection level
    path: '{{title}}/index'
    editor:
      preview: false
    fields:
      - { label: 'Title', name: 'title', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Body', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' }

```

## Understanding how the CMS is reading yaml file

```

// media folder gets saved in root directory of project
// media_folder should match the path to the repo

media_folder: static/uploads   // i.e. rootProject/static/uploads


// public folder gets saved in public directory
// public_folder should match to what you append to your
//   URL to navigate to the asset


public_folder: /uploads     // i.e. rootProject/public/uploads

```

## solve

In order to connect both the media folder and public public_folder you must refernce the folders at the file level

```
media_folder: static/img
public_folder: /img


collections:
  - ....


    media_folder: "/{{media_folder}}"
    public_folder: "/{{public_folder}}"


    path: '...



```
